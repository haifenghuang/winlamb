@page ex01 Example 1 â€“ Just a window

![Example 01](ex01.gif)

This example is just a window that does nothing.

The first window of an application is called the **main window**, which inherits from wl::window_main.

The `RUN` macro generates the [WinMain](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-winmain) function, which is the Win32 entry point. Inside WinMain, it instantiates our main window. You can write the WinMain function yourself, but unless you're doing something really specific, just let the `RUN` macro do the hard work.

In our window constructor, we call [setup()](@ref wl::window_main::setup()) to define the values that will be used when our window is created. All fields have default values, you need to modify just the ones you want.

Also, notice that native Win32 uses [UTF-16 encoding](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/intl/unicode), so we have to use `wchar_t`, `wstring`, and so on. String literals are prefixed with an `L`.

### My_Window.h

````cpp
#include "winlamb/window_main.h"

class My_Window : public wl::window_main {
public:
	My_Window();
};
````

### My_Window.cpp

````cpp
#include "My_Window.h"

RUN(My_Window) // generate entry-point and instantiate My_Window

My_Window::My_Window()
{
	setup().title = L"My first window";
	setup().style |= WS_MINIMIZEBOX; // window has minimize button
	setup().size = {300, 150};
}
